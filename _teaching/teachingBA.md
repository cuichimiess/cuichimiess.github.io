## Undergraduate Courses

- Conflict and Economic Development
 - Term: Summer Semester 2025
 - Target group: 5th semester BA students
 - Content: This course is designed to provide an introduction on current research on armed conflict and economic development, with particular emphasis on their multiple interrelationships, as well as to train students to develop sound research designs and connect theory and empirical data. Guided by the question why some countries fall into a trap of poverty and armed conflict, whereas others prosper and maintain political stability, the course surveys the leading quantitative research on the main topics in the field of comparative politics and political economy. Throughout the semester we will examine the mechanisms by which political institutions affect economic performance, how those conditions then foster different types of violent conflict, again revoking development.
