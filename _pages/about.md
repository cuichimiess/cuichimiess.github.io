Hi!

I am Cuichi N. Miess, a doctoral candidate at the Geschwister Scholl Institute of Political Science at LMU Munich.  
I work under the supervision of Paul W. Thurner on my dissertation titled *"Internationalized Civil Wars: Patterns and Consequences of Third-Party Conflict Intervention."*

In my research, I focus on the intersection between intrastate and interstate conflict dynamics. Specifically, I study the internationalization of civil wars, strategic support networks among third-party actors, and the broader impact of the international system on the trajectories of multiple civil wars.  
Quantitative methods, particularly network analysis, are central tools in my work.

Before starting my Ph.D., I completed a Double Degree in Political Science (*LMU Munich*) and Current Democracies (*Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona*).

I am passionate about understanding how civil wars and the international system mutually shape each other in complex and evolving ways.  
Currently, I also teach three undergraduate courses:
- **Conflict in African Countries: Causes and Consequences**
- **Armed Conflict in the International System**
- **Conflict and Economic Development**

If you are interested in my research, want to discuss related topics, or just want to get in touch, feel free to reach out via email.
