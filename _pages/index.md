Hi!

My name is Cuichi Miess, and I am a doctoral candidate at the Geschwister Scholl Institute of Political Science at LMU Munich.  
I work under the supervision of Paul W. Thurner on my dissertation titled *"Internationalized Civil Wars: Patterns and Consequences of Third-Party Conflict Intervention."*

In my research, I focus on the intersection between intrastate and interstate conflict dynamics. Specifically, I study the internationalization of civil wars, strategic support networks among third-parties, and the broader impact of the international system on multiple trajectories of civil wars. The aim of my research is to better understand how civil wars and the international system mutually shape each other in complex and evolving ways. Given that modern armed conflicts predominantly unfold as internationalized civil wars, studying those intersections is essential for comprehending contemporary conflicts and ultimately for developing effective strategies to contain violence and alleviate human suffering globally. For my research I mainly use quantitative methods, particularly network analysis.

Currently, I also teach three undergraduate courses. These classes are designed to deepen the students' knowledge of the respective topics, and also to methodically train them to develop sound research designs and write sophisticated papers meeting scientific standards.

Before starting my Ph.D., I completed a Double Degree in Political Science (*LMU Munich*) and Current Democracies (*Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona*).

Feel free to reach out via email if you're interested in my research or just want to connect â€” and if you happen to be in Munich, I'm always up for a coffee!
